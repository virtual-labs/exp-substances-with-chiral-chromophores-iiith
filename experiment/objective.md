The purpose of this lab is to make students familiar with different types of CD spectra obtained from different chiral substances with chromophore. By doing this experiment user will be able to,

1. Develop an understanding about assigning R and S configuration to chiral structures.   
2. Be familiar with the nature of CD curves of samples of different chirality.  
3. Understand relation between CD and ORD spectra obtained from the same sample.
